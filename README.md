# The Challenge

I have a challenge for you to - this is one that involves teamwork. There's something I want to share with you but it's *unsafe* to do so openly. Thus, I've set up a mission - one where you collaborate with other like-minded individuals to know what I have that's so important to share with you. 

This isn't incredibly difficult to do - it just needs some _out of the box_ thinking from you... there's many methods of sharing secrets... here's to hoping you find what this one is :)

## Your Mission
Should you choose to go forth with this, here's what you need to do:
- [ ] Watch this video _insert video link_
- [ ] Check the comments to see what people have found
- [ ] Get in touch with each other and solve the mystery

## Some Hints
- Cryptography
- Zero knowledge
- Adi
