# The Challenge
___Status: Work-In-Progress___

I have a challenge for you to - this is one that involves teamwork. There's something I want to share with you but it's *unsafe* to do so openly. Thus, I've set up a mission - one where you collaborate with other like-minded individuals to know what I have that's so important to share with you. 

This isn't incredibly difficult to do - it just needs some _out of the box_ thinking from you... there's many methods of sharing secrets... here's to hoping you find what this one is :)

## Your Mission
Should you choose to go forth with this, here's what you need to do:
* [ ] Step 1: Load [this](http://cryptic-one.nandanv.com) link. You only get **one chance** to view the loaded QR code
* [ ] Step 2: This QR code holds no value individually. Comment on __INSERT-VIDEO-LINK__ saying you found it
* [ ] Step 3: Find a way to get in touch with the others and crack it

## Some Hints
- Cryptography
- Zero knowledge
- Adi
